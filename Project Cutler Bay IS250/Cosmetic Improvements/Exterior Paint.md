The purchased condition of the paint is fairly poor and is made 100x worse by the fact that the car is in black. 

Color 212 factory paint purchased and tested paint chip repair on one panel. Applied with the brush in a "droplet" style and looks ok without getting too close. Proper technique would be to sand area around and apply and sand and reapply ect... There are far too many chips to do this method and I don't thing it would be worth it in the end. 

My initial plan for the paint is quick paint chip repair coupled with quick polishing/buffing and maybe surface protection. 

Surface clean completed. Paint chip repair to be completed per panel.
