Yellowing and  deterioration of headlights aesthetically look bad and reduce headlight visibility. 

The headlight restoration process I used is from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEJbKLZ7RmM) . The result was 80% from perfect, which was higher than I was expecting. The only issue came from spraying the clearcoat too closely on my first attempt to the point it was dripping and I ended up re-sanding. In total, about 7 super light coats of UV resistant, non-yellowing, glossy, clear coat were sprayed.
