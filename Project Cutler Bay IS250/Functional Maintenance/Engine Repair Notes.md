# Day 0:
- Since all engine repairs will be done concurrently so all repair notes will be bundled.
- Research indicated I was missing a 5mm allen ratchet bit as well as RTV and degreaser. All purchased from advanced auto
- Engine lightly cleaned and dusted
- More leaks in valve cover gasket identified.
# Day 1: 
- Air box and air intake pipe removed
- Various wire harness connectors disconnected and left and right bank. A few of the plastic clips were brittle and broke, may consider replace.
- Remove connection to coils on passenger bank.
- Disconnected plastic wire harness mount to passenger bank.
- Disconnected throttle position sensor
- Issue came up where throttle position sensor cable was hooked to intake manifold using a zip tie piece. Was able to unhook using a small flathead screwdriver.
- Disconnected coolant hose to throttle body. 
	- Issue came up where I did not have the correct pliers to detach clamp. Found better pliers in a fishing toolbox. 
	- Issue came up where hose was stuck to throttle body. Loosened by twisting hose then pulling very hard with throttle body as leverage. 
- Throttle body bolts removed and subsequently re tightened due to issue with an additional hose being attached to throttle body on the firewall side.

Day 2 Agenda
1. Take out hose attached to back of throttle body
2. Remove throttle body
3. Remove intake manifold and store nuts appropriately.
4. Remove additional wire harness connections to drivers bank
5. Fill in holes for intake? Not sure if I do this after I remove more.
6. Begin removing drivers valve cover.

# Day 2:
- Fuel? hose disconnected from throttle body
- Throttle body removed. Maybe I should clean it?
- All wire harness connections removed. 
	- Many clips broke, may consider purchasing new ones.
- Issue came, removal of intake manifold delayed because of Allen bolts for intake manifold started stripping. There were 5? in total and 2 of them began stripping. One of the two seriously stripped. Problem solved by pounding bit into hole to shape metal back into place (or back around the bit unnaturally) and bolt was removed but needs to be replaced. 
	- Apparently there are newer model bolts that are better but the same and they are about $1.5 each so I will probably order those from Lexus directly.
- All intake manifold bolts/connections believed to be removed, intake manifold was peeked open.
- Issue came up where car battery died again. 
	- Unknown if this is due to some energy drain that happens when I am working on the car. Ex. the mirror lights that turn on when I am in proximity to vehicle.
	- Other option is that the alternator is bad as a result of oil leaking on it to whoever over filled the oil cap.
		- Will remove alternator, get it tested and clean it. If fails test then replace 

Day 3 Agenda
1. Order new 5mm Allen bolts for intake manifold.
2. Remove alternator, get it tested.
3. Confirm removal of intake manifold and see what lies within.

# Day 3:
- Primary operation to remove alternator, bolts identified, one bolt removed.
- Realization that my car was not producing electricity because my battery was disconnected.
- Realization that there was a final Allen bolt that I missed holding the intake manifold in place.
- Took a trip to Lexus parts dealership where unfortunately the bolts were out of stock. (shocker) To be ordered online and replaced at a later day. 
	- [Lexus forums](https://www.clublexus.com/forums/is-2nd-gen-2006-2013/898333-intake-manifold-bolt-part.html) recommended to not use OEM bolts but a newer model bolts.

Day 4 Agenda
1. Recruit additional manpower
2. Remove intake manifold
3. Remove fuel pressure sensor? on the right back bank.
4. Remove valve cover gaskets
5. Clean valve cover gaskets
6. Clean block below valve cover gasket
7. Clean any RTV or stuck seals on valve cover or other contact surface on block
8. Remove spark plug seals from valve cover 
9. Replace spark plugs 
10. Clean alternator and front of engine
11. Replace O2 sensor on passenger side using rented tool

# Day 4:
- Additional manpower was not available.
- Intake manifold removed, additional line and connection on the back of the manifold that I was not aware of initially.
- Banjo bolts removed along with the accompanying 2 washers and oil filter. These go to the oil cooler I think. Pretty tough bolts with little space. 
- Problem came up where I may need hex sockets to remove fuel pressure regulator on right side of engine to access valve cover gasket. 
- Most valve cover bolts loosened. 
- Coil bolts loosened. 
- Mistake where x5 bolts intake manifold bolts ordered instead of x6. An additional one was ordered OEM from Lexus along with new PCV valve.

Day 5 Agenda
1. Remove fuel pressure regulator

# Day 5:
- Battery removed to allow access to rear fuel pressure regulator bolt
- Bolts removed from fuel pressure regulator
- Electronic connection removed from fuel pressure regulator
- Hose removed from fuel pressure regulator
- Metal hose disconnected from fuel pressure regulator held by 3/4th bolt
- Issue came up where metal lines are sitting directly above fuel pressure regulator giving maybe 1/2 inch clearance when the two 12mm bolts are removed. There probably twice that of bolt that needs to be cleared to remove it. 
	- Potential solution is to remove the two studs holding the bolt with a hex bolt. Accessing the rear one may be difficult. [As shown here.](https://youtu.be/sa5WrZofhGU?t=737)The restricting factor is a guide? bolt on the rear side that (in the video) looks like they maneuver over with the studs off. 
- Potential issue with metal fuel line running from fuel rail area to fuel pressure regulator. This line is held in place by two 10mm bolts. One of the bolts is inaccessible by socket and by normal wrench. If I need to remove this, I need a 10mm sheep's-foot socket attachment.
