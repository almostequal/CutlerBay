Hi Devon. I am writing regarding your post on asphalt roads. For some context I am a civil engineer with a few years experience working in roadway construction on FDOT projects in south Florida. I love the post and I think the message is something that our commissioners and local govt need to hear. From my perspective it is shocking how little "engineering" goes into pavement design. Its fairly trivial and is  heavily geared towards asphalt/concrete  construction on arterial/highway application using metrics like traffic volume and cumulative loads. Outside of concrete/asphalt pavement, there isn't extensive literature on loading and structural properties of brick and other pavers in an pavement application.
