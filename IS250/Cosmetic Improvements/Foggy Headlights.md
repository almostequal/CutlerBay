Yellowing and  deterioration of headlights aesthetically look bad and reduce headlight visibility. 

The headlight restoration process I used is from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEJbKLZ7RmM) . The result was 80% from perfect, which was higher than I was expecting. The only issue came from spraying the clearcoat too closely on my first attempt to the point it was dripping and I ended up re-sanding. In total, about 7 super light coats of UV resistant, non-yellowing, glossy, clear coat were sprayed.

# Further Thoughts

If I am taping off the whole front end to do paint restoration work in [[Exterior Paint]] then I might give the headlights a round 2 with more sanding at a lower grit and maybe a bit more direct clearcoat spray. 

I've seen new plastic that I can replace on the lighting housing itself but I'd guess the labor involved with that would be removing the whole front bumper and maybe parts of the front engine components ex. Washer fluid resivor.
