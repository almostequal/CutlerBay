It has been a known problem within Toyota/Lexus for cars produced from the mid 2000's to early 2010's that some leather trim pieces are defective. Defective in the sense that heat will bring the adhesive to the surface and the underlying material will become brittle. 

Such is the case for the dash and door panels of Project Cutler Bay. 

The dash is actually not in terrible condition, Only the upper most section of the dash has become sticky/shiny. Upon driving the car a few times, the glare created by this section can be a nuisance - even a hazard at times.  

Lexus/Toyota addressed this by releasing a "costumer experience program" (or something like that), this program would replace defective pieces within 10 years of the car's production. Unfortunately, the previous owner did not take advantage of this, and now, I am 13 years out of the car's production date.

## Choice

The free option is always tempting to me but in this case, the dash may be able to be tolerable but the door trim has to go. For the dash, Coverlay seems too expensive for the value it applies. Carpet cover is a bit off putting but a good value nonetheless. A carpet cover would definitely embed itself into the sticky section of the dash. After watching videos for sticky dash fix I am skeptical but if it works it works and only a section of my dash needs it. Dealer replacement, too expensive. 

The door trim is my main concern in this section. Ignoring is not an option. Replacing the old panels with the panels that the dealership would be using if I chose them is a solid choice. Fairly expensive but the quality and fitment would be great. This is a low effort high money option. Sticky dash fix is probably out of the question because the driver side is too far gone. 3rd party wrap is a fair option, the material is questionable, fitment would be questionable, but I would probably save money in the final outcome with higher effort in procurement and installation. 

## Going Forward

Sticky dash fix seems like the best first stop for the dash and maybe the rear doors if they are withering. If the outcome for the dash is bad with the sticky dash fix then carpet cover. Doors seems like OEM is the way to go if cleaning and sticky dash fix look like trash. OEM would be 500 bones but lower effort/higher payoff than any "DIY 100% fix" out there.
