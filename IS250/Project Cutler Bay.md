Project Cutler Bay documents the restoration, rehabilitation, trials, and tribulations of getting my recently purchased 2011 Lexus IS250 back on the road and looking spiffy. 

To begin, some information about the car:

- 2011 Lexus IS250 
- Black on Black Interior
- 139,0XX Miles
- 2.5L Toyota V6 (4GR-FSE)
- One Owner
- $6,500.00 Purchase Price
- Based in South Florida for its lifetime

My goal is to implement Obsidian to document total [[Costs]], [[schedule]], [[Functional Maintenance]], [[Cosmetic Improvements]], and [[Lifetime Maintenance]] as I own and put miles on the car.
