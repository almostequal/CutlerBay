Numerical costs are documented in my excel sheet [[PCB Costs.xlsx]], broken down by parts and tools.

Cost Savers
- Renting spring compressor tools 
- Borrowing a majority of the tools used
Cost Mistakes
- Purchasing Struts at AutoZone vs online suppliers .
- Purchasing Brake Fluid when I had documentation showing that it had been flushed semi-recently.
- Purchasing brake pads at Advanced Auto Parts instead of Napa
Unforeseen Costs
- Jack that I intended to use initially, broke before I needed it for Project Cutler Bay. New 3 Ton jack purchased from Harbor Freight. 
- x2 Bump stops within strut assembly were deteriorating and required replacement. Not visible from exterior.
- Sockets missing or rusted from tool set required replacement.
Mitigated Costs
- Rotors initially estimated to require replacement. Measured with micrometer and were within tolerance. 
-
